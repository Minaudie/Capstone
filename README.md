# Miranda Dorosz - CNSA Capstone Project
# 
This project was created in 3 weeks for my Capstone project at TSCT. I had no prior experience with Kotlin or Android Studio. 
The idea was to create a decorative journaling app, where you can add stickers, text boxes, shapes, etc. to create a page. 
In the 3 weeks, I created an app with a working SQLite database (using the Room library), that allowed the creation of entries.
Stickers can be added and moved around.

I will be continuing to work on this project in a separate repository.
